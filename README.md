FEATURE DISCLAIMER:
4/22: 200
4/23: 212
4/24: 212
4/25: 212
4/26: 220
if 4/23 to 4/26 get into a group and 4/22 is not in your chosen time range
the total value of the group will be (220-200) rather than (220-212) eventhough 4/22 is not in the group.
--
We made this feature to prevent the scenarios where
4/22: 200
4/23: 212
4/24: 212
4/25: 212
4/26: 212
and if 4/23 to 4/26 belongs to a group, the total value of this group is 0.
